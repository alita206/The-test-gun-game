### The Test Gun Game

>This is a simple prototype for The Test Gun Game where the player can move a gun left and right to test input mechanics. The goal of this project is to experiment with and refine basic movement controls.

<h1>Features</h1>

Simple gun movement (left and right).
Basic input handling for future mechanics.
Controls
Left Arrow or A: Move the gun to the left.
Right Arrow or D: Move the gun to the right.
How to Install

<h1>Clone the repository:</h1>

<ol>bash</ol>
<ol>Copiar c√≥digo</ol>
<ol>git clone https://github.com/alita206/The-test-gun-game.git</ol>
<ol>Open the project in Unity (or your preferred game engine).</ol>
<ol>Press play to start testing the gun movement.</ol>
</br>
Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to test input handling. It is a foundation for more advanced mechanics that will be built over time, such as shooting and aiming.

<h1>Future Development</h1>
Add vertical movement for more control.
Implement shooting mechanics and gunfire effects.
Add targets or enemies to interact with the movement.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project serves as a base for developing more advanced input systems and mechanics in a future game. It allows for early-stage testing and experimentation with control schemes.
